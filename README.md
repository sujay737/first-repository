### About Us & Functional Requirements
Mossy Reviews is a website and social media platform designed to allow people to voice their opinions on films, shows, anime, and much more. This platform is catered specifically to this idea with the functions of allowing users to interact with other people, display a large gallery of media to critique, being able to post and having a functional and aesthetic sign in page. 

#### Non-Functional Requirements
Mossy Reviews aims to be a better website than others similar ones since it provides a smoothly run website, have a dislike button for posts to promote more freedom of expression, makes post be able to saved or sent to others showing its reusability and that it has a high scalability (better backend) so more posts, the gallery and data can increase.
